# Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention (Urdu to English)
In this repository I will be implementing a neural network to translate from Urdu to English by using PyTorch library. The code is heavily inspired by the [blog](https://talharamzan-tr.medium.com/translation-with-a-sequence-to-sequence-network-and-attention-urdu-to-english-bd398d64ce5d) 

## How to Run
There are 2 methods that you can use to run this code. Both of them would require you to install the libraries listed in the requirements section.
The first method is to run all cells in the notebook. This is time consuming and requires a lot of time and compute for training so is not recommended.
The Second method is to use the already trained weights to do evaluation. After runnning the setup functions, you can go down to the final cells of the notebook and just load the weights and run inference.

## Requirements
To run this code you need the following librarires installed
Pytorch
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
NLTK
