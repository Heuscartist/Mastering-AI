# Introduction
This repository Contains Several Projects in the domain of Computer Vision. These projects are either part of my university assignments or my personal projects that I do in my spare time. Primarily the tasks are done on notebooks using google colab, anaconda or kaggle.

# Projects
## Image Similarity App
This project contains code for an image similarity app made by utilizing pretrained models to create embeddings and using similarity metrics to find similar images. Streamlit is used to create a demo web application for the project.

## U Net Image Segmentation
This project was to create a simplified U-Net architecture that is capable of detecting trash in waterways using image segmentation.
