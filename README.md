# AI Mastery Roadmap

## Introduction

This repository is meant as a personal portfolio for the domain of AI/ML. I will be uploading my personal projects done in my free time or during my academic courses on this repository. These will include projects in the domain of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Generative AI. I am also planning on working on various other domains as well such as TinyML and Reinforcement learning. 
## Books

Here are some of the books that I am following for more in depth knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
