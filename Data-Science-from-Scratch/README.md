# Data Science From Scratch â€“ Project Series

This folder contains hands-on projects created while working through **Data Science from Scratch** by Joel Grus.  
Each project is designed to reinforce concepts from the book by applying them to real datasets and producing  
clear, portfolio-ready outputs.

## ðŸ“š About This Series
The aim is to:
- Implement key **data science concepts** from scratch (without heavy libraries at first)
- Apply them to **real-world datasets**
- Practice **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization**
- Document **insights** and **code structure** for professional presentation
